### konami code
The Konami Code (Japanese: コナミコマンド, Konami komando, "Konami command") is a cheat code that appears in many Konami video games, although the code also appears in some non-Konami games.

The code was first used in the 1986 release of Gradius for the Family Computer/Nintendo Entertainment System but was popularized among North American players in the NES version of Contra, for which it was also dubbed both the "Contra Code" and "30 Lives Code".

During the title screen before the game demo begins, the player could press the following sequence of buttons on the game controller to enable the cheat:

↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A

The code has also found a place in popular culture as a reference to the third generation of video game consoles. The code is also present as an Easter egg on a number of websites.
